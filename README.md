# TurtleTrouble
Video game in which you are a turtle trying to catch jellyfish and avoid plastic bags, created for an English class. It was a lot of fun trying to finish this project in under two weeks!

To play the game yourself, all you need to do is download the 'Final Build' Folder and then open the 'Turtle Trouble.exe' file.

A short demo of how to open the game and what the game looks like is in the link below:
